Actions\n\nSo far, you’ve stored, edited, and displayed data using the Editor and Console. But to interact with the Playfield, we need something called actions. Actions are what you use to make things happen in your code—beyond just Console messages. If variables are like boxes, then actions are what you **do** with the content of those boxes. You could shake it, toss it, stack it, pour it out on the floor. The content could even be used to inspire an interpretive dance number—the possibilities are endless!\n\n#### 2. Your First Action\n\nSee the catapult at the bottom of the Playfield? Wouldn't it be great if we could drop something on it? Let’s dive in with a specific action called 'create circle.' This action needs a bit of data to work, namely which color to use for our circle. And since we already stored a color variable, we’re all set to use it. Start by clicking the lightning bolt symbol next to your `color` variable in the Editor.","{{VariableBlock|color|yellow|action","#### 3. Select an Action\n\nIn the **Action** window, make sure your `color` variable is selected. From the list of **Actions** on the right, choose `create circle` and click **Save**.

Your First Log\n\nClick the **Console Log** button to create your first log message!","{{LogButton","You can write anything you like, but let’s go with `Hello, Console!` for now. Enter your message and click **Save**. A new log block should now appear in the Editor with your message.","{{LogBlock|Hello, Console!","#### 3. Run Your Code\n\nReady? Make sure that the Console panel is expanded by clicking the **Console** tab. Then, click the **Run** button, and keep your eye on the Console. Spoiler alert: Your message should appear just like magic! Along with your message, you should also see two system messages, letting you know that your code has been run.","#### 4. Logging a Variable\n\nIn the last lesson, we created a variable with a label and a value. Now, let’s put a brand new variable to work by logging its value to the console. First, we’ll need to create a variable. Remember how? Click the **Variable** button, choose the data type **String**, enter a label and a string value. Since a label should be brief and descriptive, let’s improve on 'my first variable.' How about labelling our new variable `color`? Need help choosing a color? Click the **Show color picker** checkbox, and try out different colors until you find one that suits you. Don’t forget to **Save**.\n\n#### 5. Your Second Log\n\nOnce again, click the **Console Log** button. Enter the message `My favorite color is`, and select your `color` variable in the **Variable** dropdown. Click **Save**. Can you guess what will happen when we run the code again?","{{VariableBlock|color|yellow","{{LogBlock|My favorite color is|color","#### 6. Run Your Code\n\nClick **Run** once more. Notice that the new message doesn’t just say, “My favorite color is color”? That’s because the Console reads the actual value stored in your variable, not just its label. So, if you edit your variable, the log message will update automatically the next time you run your code! Try it out if you’re curious. Click the variable block to edit it.\n\nWell done! That wraps up our Console shenanigans for now."] | lesson-1    | lesson-3    | null                                                                                          | null     |

Think of a variable as a labeled box where we store information for safe keeping. By labeling the box, we can easily find and reuse the information whenever we need it.\n\n#### 1. Add a Variable\n\nIn the Editor, click the **Variable** button.","{{VariableButton","You'll see a selection of data types, but for now, we’ll focus on just one. Choose **String**.\n\n#### 2. Strings Are Text\n\nWhen we want to store and work with simple text, we use a data type called a *string*. Why is it called a *string*? Imagine each letter and character strung together like pearls on a necklace—this is how text data is stored in programming!\n\n#### 3. Label Your Variable\n\nRemember, variables are like labeled boxes. Let’s label this one! Since this is your first variable, let’s go with something memorable, like `my first variable`?\n\n#### 4. Give Your Variable a Value\n\nWhat’s in the box? Right now, it’s empty, so let’s fill it with some data. How about your favorite color? When you have entered the name of a color in the **Value** input field, click **Save**. \n\n","{{VariableBlock|my first variable|yellow","#### 5. Congratulations!\n\nIf you now see a little block in the Editor showing your chosen label and your color, you’ve just created your first variable! Great job!\n\nGive yourself a pat on the back, and let’s move on to the next lesson."]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | welcome     | lesson-2    | null                                                                                          | null     |
